Selected Periodicals
--------------------

1.  Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology: In-depth reviews of selected topics.
2.  Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics
3.  Drug Metabolism and Disposition
4.  Molecular Pharmacology
5.  Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics
6.  Pharmacological Reviews
7.  Molecular Interventions: Periodicals 2-7 are authoritative, official journals of the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (ASPET). No. 7 is a recent addition - short, up-to-date reviews with excellent graphics.
8.  The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics: Popular bi-weekly newsletter announcing new drugs and giving summaries of recommended drug treatment for specific clinical applications. Includes comparative cost data. Brief reviews are authoritative, but without references.
9.  Trends in Pharmacological Sciences: For the receptor afficionado. If you really want to know the latest nomenclature and selective ligands for every defined receptor subtype, you'll find the information here. Good articles (mainly review) but tend toward the heavily theoretical.
